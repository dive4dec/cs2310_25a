    "    Inheritance allows derived classes to reuse the functionality of their base classes. Through base-class pointers or references, derived class instances can be treated as base class objects, enabling polymorphism. To ensure safe polymorphic deletion, the base class must declare a virtual destructor. Classes that manage dynamic resources should implement a destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator—collectively known as the Rule of Three. For efficient resource transfer, they should also define a move constructor and move assignment operator, completing the Rule of Five.\n",
